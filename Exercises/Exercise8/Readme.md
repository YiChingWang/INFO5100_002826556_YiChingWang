# Book Parser Application

## Configuration
Important: Before running the application, make sure to update the file paths in the code to match the locations on your system where the XML and JSON book files are stored.

For example, replace:
```
/Users/olliesmacbook/Desktop/Exercise8/src/books.xml
/Users/olliesmacbook/Desktop/Exercise8/src/books.json
```
with the actual paths where you have stored these files on your device.
